function probability = direct_comp(sequence,initial_state,trans,emit)
%direct_computation HMM direct computation implementation
%   sequence is vector of numbers containing sequence of visible states
%   initial_state is first hidden state (at time t=0)
%   trans is the transition matrix
%   emit is the emission matrix
